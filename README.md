> AI-powered incident triage system designed for NOC environments in telecom and ISP operations.

---

## 🎯 Overview

**NOC-AI** interprets technical incident descriptions and automatically provides:

✔ simplified interpretation  
✔ severity classification  
✔ operational category  
✔ remediation suggestions  

This prototype demonstrates how AI can **reduce triage time**, improve operational decision-making and standardize communication inside NOC environments.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Incident interpretation (English)
- Classification engine
- Severity assessment
- Category mapping (operational domain)
- Suggested remediation actions
- Lightweight UI for demonstration
- FastAPI backend + HTML/JS frontend

> **Mapped Operational Domain**:  
✔ Infrastructure & Transport Layer

## 📡 Context: Telecom & NOC Operations

This prototype fits naturally into:

✔ NOC (Network Operation Center)  
✔ Telecom / ISP Operations  
✔ Core & Aggregation Networks  
✔ Enterprise IT Operations  
✔ Infrastructure & Transport  

NOC workflows often require:

🔹 rapid triage  
🔹 classification  
🔹 ticket enrichment  
🔹 escalation rules  
🔹 standardized language  

NOC-AI explores how AI can accelerate these steps.

## 📚 Licença

MIT License — this prototype is open for research & experimentation.

## 🎙 Positioning

This repository demonstrates **integrated technical capability** across:

✔ telecom domain knowledge  
✔ AI reasoning prototypes  
✔ backend development  
✔ UI integration  
✔ operations workflow understanding  


---

## 🧩 Future Integration — LLMs in NOC Operations

This prototype can be extended with real LLMs for reasoning-based triage, using models such as:

✔ Google Gemini  
✔ OpenAI GPT  
✔ Anthropic Claude  

When LLM inference is introduced, the system shifts toward:

> **LLM-assisted triage for telecom NOC environments.**

This enables a new class of capabilities including:

🧠 semantic interpretation  
📁 ticket enrichment  
📚 normalization of technical language  
📊 decision support for escalation  
🕑 MTTI reduction (Mean Time To Identify)  

---

## 🧪 Research Motivation — Why LLMs in NOC?

Network Operation Centers handle environment-specific incidents where variance in:

✔ vendor language (Cisco, Juniper, Huawei, Nokia)  
✔ transport stacks (MetroEthernet, MPLS, IP)  
✔ OSI layers  
✔ topology  
✔ service models (FTTx, Backbone, B2B, CDN)  

creates **high cognitive load** and **slow triage**.

LLMs can reduce this cognitive overhead by performing:

🔸 linguistic normalization  
🔸 domain mapping  
🔸 context inference  
🔸 protocol awareness  


---

## 📊 Operational KPIs for AI-assisted NOC

Potential KPIs impacted:

| KPI | Descrição |
|---|---|
| **MTTI** (Mean Time To Identify) | Tempo até identificar o tipo do incidente |
| **MTTE** (Mean Time To Enrich) | Tempo até enriquecer ticket com dados úteis |
| **MTTS** (Mean Time To Suggest) | Tempo para sugerir ações corretivas |
| **Escalation Quality** | Precisão na sugestão de equipe/nível para escalar |
| **Incident Categorization Accuracy** | Taxa de acerto na categorização |
| **Ticket Normalization Rate** | Quanto a IA reduz variação semântica |
| **Cognitive Load Reduction** | Redução de esforço mental dos analistas |
| **Operational Consistency** | Padronização inter-analista/nivel |

## 🧩 Where LLMs Integrate in NOC Workflow

Standard NOC workflow:

Incident → Triage → Classification → Enrichment → Escalation → Resolution

LLMs help mainly in:

Incident → [LLM Triage + Enrichment] → Classification → Escalation


---

## ⚠ Limitations & Considerations

LLMs in NOC environments must account for:

- network vendor vocabulary
- industry domain knowledge
- protocol stack awareness
- real-time constraints
- operational SLAs
- confidentiality & data residency


## 🎙 Closing Positioning

This project explores how AI can support network operations by enriching and accelerating incident triage workflows in telecom environments — without replacing human operational expertise.

---

## 🧭 Strategic Positioning

This project sits at the intersection of:

✔ **Product** — explores a viable tool for telecom NOC operations  
✔ **Applied Research** — evaluates LLM triage capabilities in real operational workflows  
✔ **Technical Thesis** — formalizes how AI can assist network incident analysis  
✔ **Platform Potential** — designed to integrate with NOC tooling and monitoring ecosystems  

This combination allows NOC-AI to evolve in multiple directions depending on context:

- as an internal enterprise tool
- as an ISP / telecom operational asset
- as a research artifact
- as a product prototype
- as a platform component in monitoring + ticketing stacks
